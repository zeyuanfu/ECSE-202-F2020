The goal of these four assignments is to build programming proficiency over the semester by writing and combining software components into a retro style Pong game.

### Assignment 1
Develop a Java application that simulates the motion of a ball launched from a certain height, with the user inputting a launch angle and initial velocity, that bounces in a box while taking into account a custom energy loss factor.
### Assignment 2
Build upon the work done in Assignment 1 by adding nine balls for a total of ten, all with randomized initial launch velocities, angles, energy loss factors and colors. Apply the concept of classes to separate the project into four files instead of a monolithic application.
### Assignment 3
Build upon the work done in Assignments 2 and 3 by adding a player-controlled paddle yielding nondeterministic outputs.
### Assignment 4
Build upon the work done in Assignments 2, 3 and 4 by adding an automonous, application-controlled paddle, culminating in a retro style Pong game.
